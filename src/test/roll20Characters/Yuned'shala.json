            "name": "character_backstory",
            "current": "Like many Twi’lek, I was born into slavery. My master was the Zygerrian Kiror Tha’russ. I worked with the slaves who tended to his household, a large mansion in Zygerria. I spent all of my time constantly cleaning, organizing and putting away trash and other belongings. Kiror threw elaborate parties for his clients every night, and if I couldn’t get the whole estate back into order by the next night, I was beaten severely. Often I had to return bottles of old-vintage Merenzane Gold to the top shelves of the beverage rack, which was unreachable by a four-year-old. That didn’t prevent the beatings, however. One day I was trying to get the bottles up, and I could focus on nothing but the fear of Kiror’s fury that was soon to come. Tears streamed down my face as I pictured him with his electro whip, chasing me down the halls. Suddenly, the bottle left my hand, and moved into place on its own! There were no beatings that night, and Kiror even gave me two slices of bread for dinner! \n\nDaesha’ani (Day-sha-ani) was another Twi’lek slave my age. Once she saw how Kiror was treating me, she begged me to teach her the tricks. I did so, and together we became much more efficient. With our tricks, we could realign all the treasures on the living room table with a wave of a hand, carry piles of empty glasses to the kitchen, and reach all the upper shelves and cabinets. Yet Kiror still found reasons to beat us weekly, as he would find a few specks of dust on a bottle or a napkin hidden under a cabinet that I had missed. I tried so hard to do everything right, to be the perfect slave and finally make him happy for once. One evening, I really went all out. Three times I checked every bottle, every wardrobe, every shelf, and I was confident that the house had never been more perfect. Suddenly, dozens of strange people holding glowing rods came into the house. One of these people noticed me using my trick to dust an acklay skull hanging from the ceiling. He came up to me and said, “Child, the Force is strong with you. We have come to liberate you from Kiror, that vile slaver. It seems he has escaped us, but you can come with me to the Jedi Academy, where you will learn to use the Force for the good of all.” I didn’t really understand what he was talking about, so I nodded. Daesha ran up to us and said, “Wait, take me too! I can do it as just as good as Yuned.” She showed him the tricks, and he said, “Don’t worry younglings. There is room for both of you.”\n\nThus began my training at the Jedi Academy on Coruscant. It was brutal. I was at a disadvantage academically, as until then I knew almost nothing of the world outside Kiror’s manor. I spent all of my time studying and trying to learn everything I could from the Archives, yet I still struggled to please my instructor, Dashgarr Wynfis. He didn’t beat me for failing tests, which surprised me. I easily mastered the telekinetic abilities of a Jedi, as I had been using them my whole life. However, I had many difficulties with healing and protection abilities, typically associated with the light side of the force. To invoke my powers, I always had to think about the fear and pain that Kiror put me through. Was I even doing this right? The other initiates seemed to pick up new skills easily, while I could do very little except telekinetics. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t make the progress that was expected of me. With all the time spent in study, I didn’t get to know the other initiates very well. Daesha, on the other hand, barely spent time studying, and instead she explored Coruscant and enjoyed her newfound freedom. When it came time for tests, she relied on me to help her cheat her way through. I didn’t like doing that, but she was the only friend I had, and she constantly reminded me of that. \n\nAs we grew older at the Academy, I began to develop feelings for her. I knew this was against the Jedi code, but I could tell that she felt the same way. We were the only Twi’lek initiates currently at the Academy, and we spent much of our time together. As all Twi’lek, we could communicate silently with one another using our lekku, the appendages on our heads. One night, alone in a study lounge a few days before our Initiate Trials, she asked me a question that caught me off-guard, as I had never thought about it before.\n\n“Why are we here at the Academy, Yuned? What are we going to do with our lives?”\n“I…. I don’t know, Daesha. This is where the Force brought us? This is where we can do the most good in the galaxy?”\n“But just look at the other initiates. They can heal and protect and do many things we can’t. We don’t belong here. We should be somewhere else.”\n“But Daesha, I … I like it here. I’m learning so much, and there are so many incredible people here.”\n“No, you don’t. You’re not as smart or as capable as the other students. Plus, there are so many rules! Imagine being out in the galaxy on our own, free to do whatever we want!”\n“Daesha, what are you talking about?”\n“Listen, Yuned, I met some people the other night at a bar in the city. They told me that there are other places to learn about the Force than this Academy. Places with fewer rules, where we can do what we want.”\n“Would you be happier there?”\n“Of course! Weren’t you listening to me? Well, I’m glad you agree with me. I’ll talk to them about what we need to do, and we can finally be free of this place!”\n“But I…”\n“Hey, I’m leaving whether you like it or not. You can come with me if you want, or you can be alone here forever.”\n\nI didn’t see her for the next few days. I thought about what she said, and decided that I would do my best at the Trials and see what happened after that. I began to worry about her, but then the Initiate Trials began, and she was there. I saw here sleeping through the written tests and barely even trying during the Force challenges. Finally, it was my turn for the telekinetics test. I knew that I had to do a perfect job on this test to get enough points to make up for my failures in the other parts of the trial. I had to levitate several large boulders in a complex pattern. All the initiates and instructors, including Daesha, watched as I closed my eyes and focused on Kiror. My mind filled with the terrible pain of the beatings, but that pain was so distant that I couldn’t manifest the powers using those memories. \n\nWhy now? Why just when I needed it the most? I started to get scared and overwhelmed. I couldn’t do it. I had been training for this for years and I was going to ruin it all because I wasn’t good enough. I opened my eyes for a split second and saw Daesha staring intently at me. I could sense anger and disappointment coming from her, and my fear only intensified. Failing Kiror didn’t matter to me anymore, but I could not fail Daesha. I imagined her anger if I failed her, being alone without her, and having no one who cared for me. As these emotions flooded my mind, the boulders began to rise. I gritted my teeth and began to rotate the boulders at a rapid velocity around each other. I could see a sharp smile on Daesha’s face, and then she curled her lekku together in a way to say, “I love you.” My emotions spiraled out of control as the boulders flew apart from each other into the crowd watching. Several of the instructors used the Force to catch them before harm was done, but one went towards the crowd of initiates. They moved out of the way, but then I saw the path of the boulder shift slightly. My eyes grew wide with fear as it struck an initiate in the head, instantly killing him. Then my eyes went to Daesha, and I saw her hand very slightly extended towards that boulder, and that wicked grin still on her face.\n\nThe trials were called off for the rest of the day, and we were told to return to our dormitories, but Dashgarr told me to wait. “Listen, Yuned, I know this was an accident. You are a gifted young Twi’lek. There are other ways you can serve the order besides being a Jedi knight. I have seen how hard you work and how organized you are. Have you considered serving as a librarian?”\nI suppose I couldn’t screw anything up there as badly as I could here. “I … I guess I’ll look into it” As I walked back to my dormitory, I thought about life as a librarian. Organizing holocrons, finding information deep within the vaults, and living a peaceful, simple life was very appealing to me. It seemed like it would be much easier than being a Jedi Knight, so I would make fewer mistakes and mess up less often. A spark of hope formed inside of me that I had never felt before.\n\n Later, I returned to my dormitory, and Daesha was waiting for me.\n“You did it, Yuned! You’re smarter than I ever believed. You passed the test!”\nThrough tearful eyes, I said, “What are you talking about? I killed an initiate!”\n“Yes, that is what we needed to do to prove our loyalty to my new friends! Now, we can leave this place and enjoy our freedom! We can be together, Yuned. Since we made it look like an accident, no one will know. What are you waiting for, start packing! We are leaving tonight.”\n“... No”\n“What?”\n“I said no. You’ve gone too far this time, Daesha. I don’t know who these friends of yours are, but if they wanted you to kill someone, then I don’t want to be involved.”\n“Yuned, you don’t understand this at all, do you? There is no hope for us here. We cannot succeed here. Do you know why?”\n“... It’s because we belong to the Dark Side, isn’t it.”\n“Finally you see! We can only do universal powers. We fail with light side powers. We use our fears and frustrations to use our powers. We are wasting our time here. My friends will teach us more about the Dark side, and we can achieve our true potential together.”\n“No! I will not go with you. I want to help people like the Jedi who freed me from Kiror. I want to be a librarian and keep the records of the Jedi safe.”\n“Ha, a librarian? You? That would be so boring! Spending every day stuck with dusty old holocrons? Why would you want to do that? Why would you want to be away from me? Think for once, Yuned. You will be much happier with me and my friends.”\n“... I’ve been with you for as long as I can remember, Daesha, and I’ve never been happy. I don’t want the things you want. I don’t think I can be happy with you around. Did you ever actually care about what makes me happy? Or only yourself? Get out of my room.”\nShe gasped, and a dark expression came over her face. “I’ve created this opportunity for you, but if you won’t accept my generosity, then don’t. Goodbye, Yuned. Enjoy your time in the library while I am living a real life.”\nWith that, Daesha left, and I never saw her again.\n\nLater, I joined the Jedi Librarians. Jocasta Nu was a strict but enlightening mentor. I enjoyed the discipline and precision required in maintaining thousands of records. I felt safe here, free from disappointing others, free from the potential for failure, free from the whispers of the Dark Side. But this tranquility did not last long. When I first heard that the clone wars had begun, I was not too concerned. I was safe inside the library, and there was still so much work to do, and I was starting to become friends with another librarian named Malsim Anghoul. However, eventually the jedi who freed me from slavery came to the library. “Yuned. I’m very sorry, but I must ask something of you. You have received most of the training of a Jedi knight, and the Council is in desperate need of knights to help fight this war. In spite of what happened, you were going to pass the trials if you hadn’t decided to join the librarians.” Then, he unfurled a wrapped cloth to reveal a lightsaber. “This was my master’s. He died a week ago in the battle of Geonosis. Unfortunately, there’s no time for you to build your own. We need you, Yuned, to help save the Republic.”\n\nAs a Jedi, I had no choice but to accept. My old fears began to creep back in new forms. War? So messy. So chaotic. Me fighting on the front lines? I couldn’t. I’d mess up again! I’d get people killed! Why would they trust me for this? Who do I think I am? I’m no Jedi knight. I’m a worthless Twi’lek whose greatest dream is to be stuck in a library for his whole life. I’m no leader. I’ll just have to fake it. If everyone believes I am a heroic Jedi leader, won’t they fight better, won’t they push on and survive? Am I good enough to even do that? But what choice do I have?\n",
